# What it is
🚚 A script that can be used to migrate assets to Cloudinary from sources supported by [Cloudinary Upload API](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference#upload_required_parameters) in scenarios when gradual migration with [Cloudinary auto-upload feature](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/fetch_remote_images#auto_upload_remote_files) cannot be leveraged.

It is assumed that the migration problem is addressed in stages:

- **Stage #1** 🛠️ Prepare input CSV file for the asset migration (with the tools of your choice)
- **Stage #2** 🚚 Run the migration for the assets detailed in CSV file (using this tool)
- **Stage #3** Iterate to identify assets that failed to migrate and re-attempt migration
  * 🛠️ Filter the output of the migration script (with the tools of your choice)
  * 🚚 Use the filtered output as input for the re-try migration batch (using this tool)

This script provides the following features:
- Customizable mapping of CSV records to Cloudinary API parameters
- Concurrent invocation of Cloudinary API
- Memory-efficient handling of large input CSV files
- Visual progress reporting during migration
- Detailed logging (JSONL) to track/troubleshoot each migration operation
- Migration report (CSV) produced from the migration log file

# What it is NOT
❗ This script is not a one-size-fits-all solution for migrating to Cloudinary. It serves as a foundational tool for IT and software engineers who need to migrate large volumes of assets when other options are impractical or unavailable.

# How to Use It
Follow these steps to successfully migrate your assets:

1. [📋 Prepare Your CSV Data](./readme/data-for-the-migration.md) - Ready the data for asset migration.
2. [💻 Provision Runtime](./readme/provision-runtime.md) - Set up the environment where the script will run.
3. [⚙️ Configure the Script](./readme/configure.md) - Customize the script's settings for your specific migration needs.
4. [🚚 Run the Script and Obtain the Report](./readme/run-migration-obtain-report.md) - Execute the script and review the migration report.
5. [🔄 Iterate for Failed Migrations](./readme/identify-reattempt-failed.md) - Identify failed asset migrations and rerun the script to fix them.

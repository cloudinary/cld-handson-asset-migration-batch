Once the information about the remote assets (asset URLs) and taxonomy (for example tags, metadata or any other input supported by Cloudinary Upload API) has been consolidated into a CSV file, you can leverage the toolset to:
- Quickly “map” the columns from the CSV file to the Cloudinary Upload API parameters
- Run the migration flow for all assets in the CSV file and obtain the migration report
